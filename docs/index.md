# How to Ghidra

Hello ðŸ‘‹, I will be using this repo to keep track of notes as I learn how to use Ghidra.

## Ghidra version

At the time of this repos creation I am using version 9.04 which is not listed on the Ghidra site, which is
[here](https://ghidra-sre.org/) btw, but rather on the release tab of the github page
[here](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases/tag/Ghidra_9.0.4_build)
